LAB: Message Queues
CAPS Phase 3: Complete work on a multi-day build of our delivery tracking system, adding queued delivery.

In this phase, rather than just “fire” events and hope that our vendors and drivers respond to them, we’re going to implement a “queue” system so that nothing gets lost. Every event sent will be logged and held onto by the server until the intended recipient acknowledges that they received the message. At any time, a subscriber can get all of the messages they might have missed.

In this final phase, we’ll be building out the queue itself, getting our vendors subscribed to it, and focusing on just one event - delivered to set the pattern for subscribing to, and working with queues.

Before you begin
Refer to Getting Started in the lab submission instructions for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

Building off of your previous day’s branch, create a new branch for today called ‘queue’ and continue to work in your ‘caps’ repository.

Business Requirements
Refer to the CAPS System Overview for a complete review of the application, including Business and Technical requirements along with the development roadmap.

Phase 3 Requirements
Build a set of applications to manage deliveries made by CAPS Drivers. This will simulate a delivery driver delivering a package and scanning the package code. Retailers will be able to see in their dashboard or log, a list of all packages delivered in real time. Should a delivery driver deliver many packages while the retailer is not connected to the dashboard, the retailer should be able to “catch up” and see a list of all missed events before resuming real-time monitoring.

Here are the high level stories related to this new set of requirements.

As a vendor, I want to “subscribe” to “delivered” notifications so that I know when my packages are delivered.
As a vendor, I want to “catch up” on any “delivered” notifications that I might have missed so that I can see a complete log.
As a driver, I want to “subscribe” to “pickup” notifications so that I know what packages to deliver.
As a driver, I want to “catch up” on any “pickup” notifications I may have missed so that I can deliver everything.
As a driver, I want a way to “scan” a delivery so that the vendors know when a package has been delivered.
And as developers, here are some of the development stories that are newly relevant to the above.

As a developer, I want to create a system of tracking who is subscribing to each event.
As a developer, I want to place all inbound messages into a “queue” so that my application knows what events are to be delivered.
As a developer, I want to create a system for communicating when events have been delivered and received by subscribers.
As a developer, I want to delete messages from the queue after they’ve been received by a subscriber, so that I don’t re-send them.
As a developer, I want to create a system for allowing subscribers to retrieve all undelivered messages in their queue.
Technical Requirements / Notes
Overview
We are adding a new module to the CAPS Application Server to garauntee that payloads from events are delivered to any Client Module that is listening for specfic events. This lab will have you refactoring the Server and Client Modules to facilitate storing of payloads Server side and removing them when received by clients.

Our Server is going to have the same overall functionality, but we want to incoporate a few quality of life features:
We want a feature to keep a log of payoads that reach our system, keyed by retailer and event type.
“publish” payloads to the appropriate Clients for the appropriate events.
Client Vendor Applications that retailers would run, should subscribe to appropriate Vendor Queues so that they can be alerted when a delivery was made.
When a client receives a message, it will need to let the hub server know that it was received.
The hub server should then delete the message.
Client can ask for all undelivered messages from the server.
Each of these would also need to be acknowledged upon receipt.
Global Event Pool (HUB)
Use the socket.io npm package to configure an event Server that can be started at a designated port using node.
We still need the Server to configure socket connections to the caps namespace on a specified PORT.
Create a Message Queue that can store payloads for specific Clients.
Each payload that is read by the pickup event should be added to a Queue for Driver clients.
Each payload that is read by the delivered vent should be added to a Queue for Vendor clients.
This could be as simple as an Object or Array, or as complex as a Module that connects to and performs operations against a database.
Add a received event to the Global Event Pool.
When this event is heard on the server, assume it’s a Client Module telling you a payload was sucessfully read.
The payload should include the client id, event name, and message id, so that you can delete it from the Queue.
Add a getAll event to the Global Event Pool.
The payload should include the client id and event name.
When this event is heard on the server, find each of the messages in the queue for the client, for the event specified.
Go through each of the entries for the client/event in the queue (if any) and broadcast them to the client.
Refactor the delivered, pickup, and in-transit events in the Global Event Pool.
We need to be able to add payloads to the appropriate Queue for specific Clients.
When these events are triggered, add the payload immediately to the appropriate Queue.
Broadcast the same event, with the following payload to all subscribers.
 {
   messageID: "Unique-Message-ID",
   payload: ORIGINAL.PAYLOAD
 }
Vendor Client Application(s)
Create 2 seperate “stores” that use the Vendor Client module:
Create one store called acme-widgets and 1-800-flowers.
Connect to the CAPS Application Server using the caps namespace.
Both stores should “subscribe” to different Queues, since they are seperate stores.
On startup, your client applications should “publish” a getAll event that fetches all messages from the server that are in that “store’s” Queue (events/messages they’ve not yet received).
Let the queue server know that your application handled this event (message id) so that it can de-queue it.
Trigger the received event with the correct payload to the server.
Subcribe to the delivered Queue.
Each client should be able to receive payloads “published” to the devlivered Queue.
We still want to log a confirmation withe the “order-id” and payload.
Driver Client Application
Refactor Event logic to use Queues.
Make sure you Driver Client is subscribing to appropriate Queues if necessary.
Upon connection, Driver Client be fetching any messages added to the appropriate Queue.
CODE QUALITY / ENGINEERING GOALS
Once you have the application fully functional, consider ways to enhance your implementation by drying out your code, and making it easier to extend in the future.

Rather than simply putting all of the required logic in every file, create a Queue class library that you can include in each of the applications (api, clients) to uniformly communicate, subscribe, etc with the Queue server. Endeavor to make integrating new client applications easy.

For example, this would be the ideal code for a client subscriber application (above). Given this as your target, how would you write the queue.js file noted in the code below to handle the above requirements?

const Queue = require('./lib/queue.js');
const companyID = 'flowers-r-us';
const clientID = 'driver';
const queue = new Queue(companyID);

queue.subscribe('delivered' delivered);
queue.trigger('getall', clientID);

function delivered(payload) {
  console.log('Flowers Were Delivered', payload.code);
}
Testing
Start all 3 servers.
Queue Server.
Both Client Application Servers.
Stop one of your applications servers.
Re-Send some requests to your queue.
This should leave some undelivered messages.
Re-Start the application server.
It should do an immediate request of all queued messages and log them out normally.
Web Server Visual Tests
Open this Web Application.
Setup Queue server URL in the settings tab.
This will POST to /delivery on http://localhost:3000 and simulate a delivery.
If your lab is working, this app will show delivery notifications in the correct columns.
If you leave the website and do manual deliveries as before from the CLI apps you’ve built and then re-visit the website later on….
The website will attempt to getall from your queue.
It should report all deliveries that were made while you were not connected.
