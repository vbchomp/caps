LAB: Socket.io
CAPS Phase 2: Continue working on a multi-day build of our delivery tracking system, moving event management to socket.io.

In this phase, we’ll be moving away from using Node Events for managing events, instead refactoring to using socket.io, which takes on some of the complexity we had to manage ourselves, and also works equally well between servers and with websites.

The intent here is to build the data services that would drive full dashboard where we can see pickups and deliveries as they happen.

Before you begin
Refer to Getting Started in the lab submission instructions for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

Building off of your previous day’s branch, create a new branch for today called ‘socket.io’ and continue to work in your ‘caps’ repository.

Business Requirements
Refer to the CAPS System Overview for a complete review of the application, including Business and Technical requirements along with the development roadmap.

Phase 2 Requirements
In Phase 2, we’ll be changing the underlying networking implementation of our CAPS system from using node events to using a library called socket.io so that we can do networked events. Socket.io manages the connection pool for us, makes broadcasting much easier to operate, and works well both on the terminal (between servers) and with web clients.

The core functionality we’ve already built remains the same. The difference in this phase is that we’ll be creating a networking layer. As such, the user stories that speak to application functionality remain unchanged, but a new set theme emerges to get us through the refactoring.

As a vendor, I want to alert the system when I have a package to be picked up.
As a driver, I want to be notified when there is a package to be delivered.
As a driver, I want to alert the system when I have picked up a package and it is in transit.
As a driver, I want to alert the system when a package has been delivered.
As a vendor, I want to be notified when my package has been delivered.
And as developers, here are some of the development stories that are relevant to the above.

As a developer, I want to create network event driven system using Socket.io so that I can write code that responds to events originating from both servers and web applications
Technical Requirements / Notes
In order to switch from Node Events to Socket.io, the refactoring process will involve changes to each application to use the core features of Socket.io.

Overview
The goal of this lab is to create a namespaced Socket.io event server, and to configure Vendor and Driver Client Modules.

The Socket Server will create a namespace of caps that will receive all CAPS event traffic.
Each Vendor and Driver Client will connect to the caps namespace.
The server will emit specific events to each socket that is listening for their designated events from the Global Event Pool defined in the Server.
Each Vendor will only emit and listen for specific events based on their Vendor ID. This will be managed by rooms within Socket.io.
Each Driver will “pick up” a package when the vendor notifies the Server that an “order” is ready and simulate “in-transit” and “delivered” events.
The expected output of the 3 running applications is the same as it was in Phase 2.

Output

Note: this is the heart of refactoring. The end result appears to be the same even after you’ve made a holistic change on the underlying code to be cleaner and faster. As developers, we want to do great work without changing the users’ experience.

Global Event Pool (HUB)
Use the socket.io npm package to configure an event Server that can be started at a designated port using node.
Accept connections on a namespace called caps, and configure socket objects from clients.
Ensure that client sockets are connecting to their approriate room if specified.
Configure a Global Event Pool that every client socket should listen for:
pickup - this will be broadcast to all sockets.
in-transit - this will be emitted only to Vendors that have joined the appropriate room.
delivered - this will be be emitted only to Vendors that have joined the appropriate room.
NOTE: You may need to create an extra event here that allows clients to join “rooms”.

Vendor Client Application
Connects to the CAPS Application Server using socket.io-client:
Make sure your module connects using the caps namespace.
Upon connection, use a Vendor ID to join a room, this can be a store name.
Upon connection, simulate a new customer order:
Create a payload object with your store id, order id, customer name, address.
Emit that message to the CAPS server with an event called pickup.
Listen for the delivered event coming in from the CAPS server.
Log “thank you for delivering payload.id to the console.
After the delivery event has been received, exit the application using process.exit().
Driver Client Application
Connects to the CAPS Application Server using socket.io-client:
Make sure this module is using the caps namespace to connect to the Server.
Once connected, the Driver client module should listen for any appropriate events from the Server:
When a pickup is emitted from the Server, simulate all specified Driver behaviors.
Simulate the following events and emit payloads to the CAPS Application Server upon receiving a “pickup” event:
in-transit
Log “picking up payload.id” to the console.
emit an in-transit event to the CAPS server with the payload.
delivered
emit a delivered event to the CAPS server with the payload.
When running, the vendor and driver consoles should show their own logs. Additionally, the CAPS server should be logging everything.

Notes
You will need to start your servers up in the right order so that you can visually test things out.
CAPS - needs to be up so that it can accept and re-emit events.
vendor - needs to have a running server to connect to, so that it can hear events.
driver - also needs the server to be running and for vendors to be placing orders.
Visual Validation
We have deployed a web application that’s designed to test your Server. This is a good way to ensure that your system works as expected. There’s nothing to “turn in” here, this is provided for your benefit.

Open this Web Application.

It will connect to the socket.io server URL you specify (localhost or Heroku) and will subscribe to the vendor named 1-206-flowers.

If your sever, vendor and driver apps are all running according to the lab instructions and your vendor has the store name 1-206-flowers, this application will show the full supply chain as a real-time dashboard. Imagine yourself at the command center, watching status updates…

Stretch Goal
Instead of simply having the Vendor application send messages every 5 seconds (in fact, turn that vendor application OFF!), write a separate app using express, with a single route: POST /pickup that accepts an object that looks like the object you are currently creating in the vendor application.

{
  "store": "1-206-flowers",
  "orderID": "65c17431-d1f5-432c-890f-d81788e38c1c",
  "customer": "Juston Reichel",
  "address": "Lake Al, OK"
 }
When that route is hit, have the express server fire the event to the socket server with the pickup event with that object payload. This should kick off the same series of events that the setInterval() was doing in the vendor application, but using a web browser instead of automation to do each one.

Assuming your small api server runs on port 3001, the form in the test app will hit that route if you have done this step.

Testing
Write tests around all of your units.
Test event handler function (not event triggers themselves).
Use spies to help testing your logger methods (assert that console.log was called right).
